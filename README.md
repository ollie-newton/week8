# Flipped activities for COMP0034 2022-23 Week 8

## Set-up

You will need to a Python environment
e.g. [create](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
and [activate](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment)
a venv.

Install the packages from requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Install the project code `pip install -e .`

If you are creating the REST API only then you can edit requirements.txt to remove scikit-learn and pandas.

If you are using poetry and need a pyproject.toml then please rename pyproject.txt to pyproject.toml. Remove
scikit-learn and pandas if you are not working on the Iris App.
